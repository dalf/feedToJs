feedToJs
========

Convert RSS and Atom feeds to an common JS structure. 
If you want to use it, be aware about the same origin policy.

A small template system is used internally to parse RSS and Atom.
It is used JQuery because XPath is not supported by IE 10...

Not tested : the template system should be able to managed HTML document.
